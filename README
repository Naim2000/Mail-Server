# Mail Server
Server for handling the Nintendo Wii's message system.

## Future plans:
- Open source API for dispatching messages across message boards.
  - Creators will be able to have their own "community" to which users can subscribe to.
  - Creators can then upload messages and send to subscribed message boards.

- Direct integration with Dolphin Emulator
